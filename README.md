## Roadmap
- [x] Implement CPU emulation and testing. 
- [ ] Implement PPU emulation and testing.

## Testing
Regarding testing, some components have unit tests written. It is a very small percentage tbh.
It should cover much more, but I'm just a dev, PRs are welcome :D.  
  
Regarding CPU testing, I've used [retrio/gb-test-roms](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms) testing 
ROM `cpu_instrs`. Probably I should use more, probably as the development continues I'll use some more!
